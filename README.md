Awesome Project is a cross-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac OS) project which targets .Net Core framework and is written in VSCode.

It consists of four individual projects.

 * An OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server built with Asp.Net Core (AwesomeServer)
 * A REST Web API built with Asp.Net Core (AwesomeAPI)
 * A .Net Core library (AwesomeLib) used from the above projects
 * A SPA built with Angular 2 (AwesomeApp)

It's a full featured example where a Calendar SPA user gets access to his API resources after signing into the app through a *Facebook*, a *Twitter*, a *Google* or an *Awesome* (our authorization server) account.

There are many Asp.Net Core concepts that are presented like Middlewares, Routing, Configuration, Error handling, Globalization and Localization, Extensions, Logging, Multiple Environments, MVC, Filters, ViewModels, Identity etc.

All projects are configured to work in any (from the above) OS and are ready to be published.

Every project includes its own README file for details.
